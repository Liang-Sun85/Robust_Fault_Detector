# Robust_Fault_Detector
A robust localization fault detection method for Mobile Robots. The repository contains following file and folders:
- RobustDetector.ipynb is the implementation of the proposed method,
- Map includes two experimental environments, and the obstacles coordinates in the first experimental environment. Map 1 is the experimental environment in which the first three experiments were used, and Map 2 is the experimental environment in which the fourth experiments was used.
- Experimental data includes the samples run of all experiments described in paper. The experiment1 data are the original data, and they have not to be truncated correspondingly.
